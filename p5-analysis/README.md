This library provides a programmatic API for finding, analyzing, and generating
[P5.js sketches](https://p5js.org). It was created for the
[p5-server](https://github.com/osteele/p5-server#p5js-server) command-line tool,
and the [P5 Server Visual Studio Code
extension](https://github.com/osteele/vscode-p5server#readme).

The API consists of three classes:

- {@link Sketch} represents an sketch. This is at least a script file, and may
  also include an HTML file and additional scripts an  assets. It is the
  interface to generate sketch files, find associated files, infer libraries,
  and scan directories for sketches that they contain.

- {@link Script} represents a JavaScript file. It provides script analysis
  features that are used to detect whether a script is a p5.js sketch, and to
  perform automatic library inclusion.

- {@link Library} represents a [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/libraries/).

The API reference is [here](https://osteele.github.io/p5-server/p5-analysis/).

These APIs are not stable until this package reaches version 1.0.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save p5-analysis
yard add p5-analysis
```

## Command-Line Usage

`p5-libraries list` – list the known libraries

With `--json`, this can be used with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), e.g.
`yarn cli:libraries list --json | jq '.[].importPath'` to list all the import
paths, or `yarn cli:libraries list --json | jq '.[] | select(.packageName) |
.name'` to print the names of libraries that have been published as NPM
packages.

`p5-libraries check all` – validate the library homepages, import paths, and
other properties

`p5-library describe LIBRARY_NAME` – print the name, home page, import path,
and defines of a specific library

`p5-library property LIBRARY_NAME import-path [--html]` – print the import path
for named library. With the `--html` options, print a `<script>` element that
can be included in an HTML page.

`p5-library docs [-o OUTPUT] [-t TEMPLATE]` – create a documentation page that
lists all the libraries. TEMPLATE should be a
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) file.

`p5-tree PATH` – print the sketches in PATH and its subfolders, and the files
 and libraries that each sketch uses.

`p5-analyze sketch PATH` - print the files and libraries associated with a
sketch

If [p5-server](https://osteele.github.io/p5-server/) is installed, these
commands can also be accessed via `p5 analyze`, `p5 libraries` and `p5 tree`
(without the hyphen).

### API

```js
import { Sketch } from "p5-analysis";

let { sketches } = Sketch.analyzeDirectory(); // find all the sketches in a directory

let sketch = Sketch.fromFile('sketch.js');
console.log(sketch.description);
console.log(sketch.libraries);
console.log(sketch.files);
```

See the source to [p5-server](https://github.com/osteele/p5-server)
for additional usage examples.

## Implementation Notes

### Sketch detection

A “JavaScript-only sketch file” is a JavaScript file that includes a function
definition for `setup()` function, and a call to `createCanvas()` (and does not
itself define `createCanvas`).

An HTML sketch file is an HTML file that includes a `<script>` element with a
`src` attribute that ends in `p5.js` or `p5.min.js`.

A directory is recognized as a sketch if it contains a single sketch and either
no loose files, or the only loose file is a README.

### Sketch descriptions

The directory listing displays the sketch description. For an HTML sketch, this
is the value of the `content` attribute of the `<meta name="description">`
element. For a JavaScript sketch that begins with a block comment, this is the
paragraph that begins with "`Description:` " in that block.

### Automatic library inclusion

JavaScript-only sketches can automatically include any of the libraries in [this
list][libraries]. For example, if the sketch source contains a call to
`loadSound`, the sketch will include the p5.sound library. If the sketch source
 refers to `ml5`, the sketch will include the ml5.js library.

Automatic library loading is done by examining the free variables, and
references to `p5.prop` where `prop` is any property name, in the JavaScript
source.

A list of libraries, and the global variables that trigger including a library,
is in `./src/libraries.json`.

### Associated files

The directory listing groups the files that are associated with a project into
the card for that project.

The files that are associated with an HTML file are just the local script files
that are included via the `<script>` tag and `<link>` tags. The server does not
inspect `<img>` tags,
etc., and it does not inspect CSS files.

The files that are associated with a script file are the string literal
arguments to functions whose names begin with `load`, such as `loadImage()` and
`loadModel()`. The server will recognize `cat.png` as an associated file in the
first call below, but not in the others:

```js
loadImage("cat.png"); // recognizes `cat.png` as an associated file
```

```js
let name = "cat.png";
loadImage(name); // does not recognize any associated files
```

```js
let name = "cat";
loadImage(`${name}.png`); // does not recognize any associated files
```

```js
for (let name of ['dog.png', 'cat.png']) {
  loadImage(name); // does not recognize any associated files
}
```

```js
let loader = loadImage;
loader("cat.png"); // does not recognize any associated files
```

## Limitations

- This code hasn't been tested on Windows.
- Generated sketches require an internet connection to run. (However: see the
  [airplane mode][airplane-mode] features of [p5 server][p5-server].) They load
  the p5.js libraries and other libraries from a content delivery network
  (“CDN”). Browsers cache these files, so reloading a page or running other
  sketches that use the same (or no) libraries do not require additional
  internet access, but you will need internet access the first time you use this
  extension or after the browser cache has expired.
- This code hasn't been tested with
  [instance-mode](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode)
  sketches.
- Automatic library inclusion hasn't been tested with sketches that are written
  as
  [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
- See the implementation notes for limitations on the recognition of associated
  files.
